## Project Description
This project is aimed at demonstrating data wrangling and visualization techniques to handle and analyze real-world data. The process involves cleaning, transforming, and visualizing datasets using various tools and libraries to extract meaningful insights.

The project follows a structured approach to break down data problems, clean and preprocess the raw data, and present it in an understandable format through various visualization techniques.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized into the following main folders:
- **datasets/**: Contains raw datasets that have been used for analysis.
- **scripts/**: Includes all Python scripts responsible for cleaning, transforming, and visualizing the data.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks showcasing step-by-step data wrangling and visualization processes.
- **outputs/**: Contains final output files such as cleaned datasets and generated visualizations.
